# Description of carbon loss project

The goal of this project is to estimate Carbon loss from disturbance using remotely sensed data from Canada's boreal peatlands and forests (Figure 1). Peatlands (*Sphagnum*) are **wetlands** ^[Marshes, Swamps and peatlands] containing partly decomposed plant materials (Wieder, et al., 2008), while forests are defined as areas with canopy cover < 10% and tree heights < 3 m. Both peatlands and trees serve as significant reservoirs of carbon stocks in boreal forests, with a substantial portion of this zone located in Canada. However, these ecosystems are releasing accumulated biomass from both trees and below ground, primarily due to climate-induced changes in wildfires. This human-induced climate change is causing fuels in forests and peatlands to dry out, rendering this ecosystem more susceptible to wildfires. These fires release carbon dioxide and other harmful gases into the atmosphere, impacting both health and plant biomass stocks.

Understanding and accurately predicting the areas vulnerable to burning is crucial for effective wildfire prevention measures (Parks, 2014). Additionally, reporting the amount of biomass lost from fires provides essential feedback for climate-carbon modeling and improvement.
In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.

Motivated by these considerations, Chinyere's research interests encompass **wildfire**, **biomass**, **carbon**, **peatlands**, **forests**, and **remote sensing**. I am particularly intrigued by exploring how remotely sensed data from instruments like Landsat, which employ optical sensors and active sensors such as lidar, can be employed to map biomass loss resulting from major disturbances like wildfires.

# Project assests 

The table and scatterplot showing carbon loss and dNBR for fires  between 2000 to 2010. 


```{r}

carbon_loss <- read.csv("/Users/chinyereottah/Desktop/Mac/R_course/Session3_Projects_and_Reproducible_Environments/Carbon_loss_from_disturbances/Response_variable/carbon_loss.csv")

library(dplyr)
kable(carbon_loss[, c("Carbonloss", "dNBR")], caption = "Carbon Loss Table") %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) 


# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)

# Perform linear regression

model <- lm(Carbonloss ~ dNBR, data = carbon_loss)

# Summarize the regression results

summary(model)

# Create a scatter plot

plot(carbon_loss$dNBR, carbon_loss$carbonloss, main = "Scatter Plot of dNBR vs Carbon Loss",
     xlab = "dNBR", ylab = "Carbon Loss")
     
#  regression line

abline(model, col = "red")

# legend

legend("topright", legend = "Regression Line", col = "red", lty = 1, cex = 0.8)
